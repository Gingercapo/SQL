# SQL

### Introduction 

> I learnt how to write Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with a database. I don't need to download any software, and I will still be able to test my skills!  SQL is an extremely in demand skill. Tons of jobs use SQL, and in the this project i will be learning how to utilize SQL to analyze data and answer business questions.  

### Project 

The skills i learnt in the project are directly extendable to writing SQL in other environments outside of postgres. For this project at the end of these project, I will download a program that will allow you to write code on your local machine. I then analyze and answer business questions using data associated with a ```music store``` by querying their database.  

### Lesson Outline 

There are three Project in this Nanodegree aimed at helping me understand how to write SQL queries. If you choose to take the Predictive Analytics Nanodegree or the Data Analyst Nanodegree programs, these three project will also be a part of these programs. However, there is also an additional lesson on Advanced 

> ***SQL also taught by Derek!  The three lessons in this course aim at the following components of SQL:***

1. **SQL Basics** 
- Here you will get your first taste at how SQL works, and learn the basics of the SQL language. You will learn how to write code to interact with tables similar to the ones we analyzed in Excel earlier. Specifically, you will learn a little about databases, the basic syntax of SQL, and you will write your first queries!  

2. **SQL Joins** 
- In this lesson, you will learn the real power of SQL. You will learn about Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and how to join multiple tables together from a relational database. The power to join tables is what really moved companies to adopt this approach to holding data.  

3. **SQL Aggregations** 
- In this final lesson, you will learn some more advanced features of SQL. You will gain the ability to summarize data from multiple tables in a database.  At the end of these three lessons, you will be ready to tackle the project. The project aims to assure you have mastered these three topics, but you will also see some of the more advanced queries that were not covered in this course. These are just meant to introduce you to the advanced material, but don't feel discouraged if you didn't get these - they were beyond the scope of the class, and they are not required to pass the project!

### Why Businesses Like Databases
***Data integrity is ensured*** - only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database.


***Data can be accessed quickly*** - SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results.


***Data is easily shared*** - multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.
